## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Your users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
2. See all countries from the API on the homepage
3. Search for a country using an input field
4. Filter countries by region
5. Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
6. Click through to the border countries on the detail page
7. Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- JSX
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - HTTP Request
- [React-router](https://reactrouter.com/) - For routing

<br />


### What I learned

I learned how to build the Power Automate flow to recieve data when a user submits the form. I used Axios to make HTTP requests to the API. I still looking for more ways to build Web Apps that leverages on APIs.

<br />


### Continued development
I still looking for more ways to build Web Apps that leverages on APIs. I will be building more projects that uses APIs.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - ChatGPT helped me get answers to my questions during development. And general errors I had during development.
- The official documentation for the libraries I used helped me alot.
